First we downloaded our file containing all the work of the project.
 we linked the "bot.py" file with our game. 
to run the game,link the bot and model.py file with your code and in terminal, run the command "python controller.py 1" and then wait for the processing of the model. 
make sure u have the necessary libraries intalled. 
when our game will reach to an end and will terminate,
 at that time all the pre-processing will be shown on the terminal after the command "python controller.py 1" executed on the terminal. 
The file "bot.py" contains all the functions linked with our respective classes.
